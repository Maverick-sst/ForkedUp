# ForkedUp


ForkedUp is a full-stack web application designed to revolutionize food discovery. Inspired by the engaging format of short-form video content, it allows users to visually explore dishes from local food partners through video reels and order seamlessly. This project serves as a comprehensive example of building a modern web application using the MERN stack and related technologies.
